### Basic Site Structure

Listing down some of the basic structure/ to-do's for the website:

- **_layouts:** This includes how to structure of each of the sections is decided:
    - **Default.html** : This is the base structure for all the pages across the site. Includes header and bosy and use this **to make changes across ALL pages & header/ footer of the site.**
    - **Page.html** : This is the default structure for most pages; like readme, work summary, index etc.
    - **Blog.html** : This is the layout for the /blog list of the site. Used to customise a gist of all the blogs written so far; including title for each blog, a snippet and Read more
    - **Post.html**: This is the layout for individual posts in the blog.
- **Includes :** This contains the header html for individual components:
    - **Analytics.html**:  ****This includes G-Tag Id and used to push GA events for the site. **IGNORE**
    - 
- **Images :** This is the repository of all the images in the site. You can then include them anywhere in the site.
- **_sass:** This is the additional CSS file to do custom styling. **IGNORE**
- **config.yml:** This is the basic structure of the website. **IGNORE**
- **Style.scss:** Use this to change any of the CSS params for the site. If you want to customise the styling for a specific section anywhere, do so by creating a class (eg: blogheader, blogsubtext).

    ![{{Image Title}}](/images/image_name.png)
