ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, welcome to my online home! 

Iâ€™m Prince Jain, a Product Manager at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/), Indiaâ€™s leading e-commerce company. I currently work in the GenAI Assistance charter, building Flippiâ€”a conversational AI assistant leveraging the latest in LLMs. Before this, I was part of the Growth Hacking charter, running rapid, low-cost experiments to optimize the user funnel and boost GMV.

Prior to Flipkart, I spent nearly three years at [Paytm](https://www.paytm.com/), working on Mini Apps and Paytm Health.

My journey in PMing has been driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to create impactful solutions that meet user needs. Iâ€™m passionate about understanding user needs, defining product vision, and lately leveraging AI to build impactful solutions and optimise workflows and Product Management. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, exploring AI tools, and occasionally coding things like the [ChatGPT Google Meet Summarizer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-google-meet-summa/kofkiemddfpekcadmaeheonbbkhnclhj)
