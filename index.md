ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, welcome to my online home!

I am Prince Jain, a passionate Product Manager currently working at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/), India's leading e-commerce company. At Flipkart, I am part of the Growth Hack charter, where I run low-cost, rapid experiments to boost platform GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) and increase Monthly Active Customers. 

Before joining Flipkart, I honed my skills as a Product Manager at [Paytm](https://www.paytm.com/), where I worked on innovative projects like Mini Apps and Paytm Health charters. My journey in product management has been driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to create impactful solutions that meet user needs.
