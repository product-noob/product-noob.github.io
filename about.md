If you landed here without knowing me at all, here is a little something about me.

I graduated from NIT Jaipur as an electrical engineer but the desire to be associated with technology led me to join Oracle as a software developer. There I learned the intricacies of software development and helped build the first version of the [Data Governance Studio](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E93133_01/PDF/8.0.6.0.0/OFSAA_DM_Pack_DGS_US_Regulatory_Reporting_8.0.6.0.0_User_Guide.pdf).

I eventually (and thankfully quickly) realised I was intrigued more by other parts of the business and product than just the engineering and also due to some well placed FOMO, I took the plunge and joined a full time MBA program at FMS Delhi. There, I wanted to explore the various fancy career options available before settling in one and joined Citibank as a Finance intern in their [Treasury & Trade Solutions](https://www.citibank.com/tts) team. There I got a chance to work with so-and-so's of the banking world and figured finance is not for me.
I also tried my hands in a bunch of corporate competitions during my MBA tenure, highlight being getting a chance to present my idea on National Television and winning 5-lacs in Reckitt Benckiser's [Case Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=180lua2YSTI&t=502s).

Thankfully I circled back on technology and chose Product Management as the choice of career and joined Paytm as a PM post my graduation. There I got a chance of work on a bunch on super interesting 0 to 1 problems including building the ["Paytm Mini Apps Store"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuK7Ct59Vyk&t=3161s), bringing the crazy idea of a [Vaccine Slot Finder](https://princejain.me/2021/08/03/Building-Vaccine-Slot-Finder.html) to life and laying the foundation of Paytm Health vertical.

After spending almost 3 years in Paytm, I decided to explore PMing in a different industry and joined Flipkart (India's leading e-commerce company) as a Product Manager. Its been more than 2 years here now and I currently work in GenAI charter, helping build "[Flippi](https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkart-launches-chatgpt-powered-shopping-assistant-flippi/)" a conversational chatbot for users on Flipkart using the latest advancements in AI & Large Language Models.
Prior to this I worked in the Growth Hacking charter, running rapid low-cost cross-funnel experiments to optimize on user funnel and improve platform GMV.

When I am not working on solving product problems, I love to spend my time reading, browsing through X (Twitter), dissecting product flows, occasionally writing for this blog and binge on Netflix. I find cooking as a good escape from the daily hustle and bustle of life.
